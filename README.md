SMF Extension for LibreOffice Calc
===
The SMF extension allows you to create customized spreadsheets with stock market data directly from the web. Currently supported online sources include [Morningstar](http://morningstar.com) and [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com).

### Download   
You can download the current version of the SMF Extension here [![][shield:release-latest]][GIT:release]

The SMF extension can also be found on the [LibreOffice Extension Center](http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/smf-extension).

**NOTE**: The extension itself is SMF.oxt.  The example .ods worksheets demonstrate how to use the extension.

### Usage

The SMF Extension adds four new functions to Calc:  
```
GETYAHOO(Ticker,Datacode) 
GETMORNINGKEY(Ticker,Datacode) 
GETMORNINGFIN(Ticker,Datacode)
GETMORNINGQFIN(Ticker,Datacode)
GETYAHOOHIST(Ticker, Date, Datacode)
```  

Quotes **must** be used when entering the ticker directly ex: ```GETYAHOO("AAPL",1)```, but are **not** needed when referencing another cell ex: ```GETYAHOO(A1,1)```.

In the latter case the data in A1 should be ```AAPL```, not ```"AAPL"```.

**NOTE**: The full set of datacodes are demonstrated in the example .ods worksheets included with the release.
